## Slide 6: Performance Optimization
**Comprehensive Performance Tuning**

**Optimization Areas**:
- Code optimization (algorithms, data structures)
- Database optimization (queries, indexing)
- Network optimization (compression, CDN)
- Resource optimization (memory, CPU, I/O)

**Improvements**:
- API Response: 40% improvement (200ms → 120ms)
- Analysis Speed: 25% improvement
- Memory Usage: 30% reduction
- Throughput: 50% increase (1000 → 1500 req/s)

---

## Slide 7: Performance Metrics
**Optimization Results**

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| API Response | 200ms | 120ms | 40% |
| Analysis Speed | Baseline | +25% | 25% |
| Memory Usage | Baseline | -30% | 30% |
| Throughput | 1000 req/s | 1500 req/s | 50% |

**Additional Optimizations**:
- Multi-layer caching
- Async operations
- Connection pooling
- Resource pooling

---

## Slide 8: Security Metrics
**Security Posture**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Critical Vulnerabilities | 0 |
| High Vulnerabilities | 0 |
| Security Test Pass Rate | 100% |
| Penetration Test | Passed |
| Compliance | Enterprise Standards |

**Security Score**: 95/100

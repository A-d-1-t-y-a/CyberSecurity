    with open(semantic_analyzer_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(self._get_enhanced_semantic_analyzer())
        
    # Intelligent tool selector
    tool_selector_file = self.project_root / 'src' / 'framework' / 'intelligent_tool_selector.py'
    with open(tool_selector_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(self._get_intelligent_tool_selector())
        
    # Performance optimizer
    performance_optimizer_file = self.project_root / 'src' / 'framework' / 'performance_optimizer.py'
    with open(performance_optimizer_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(self._get_performance_optimizer())
```
Creates advanced features with machine learning capabilities and intelligent optimization.

### Enhanced Semantic Analyzer Implementation
```python
class EnhancedSemanticAnalyzer:
    def analyze_results(self, results: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Extract features from results
        features = self._extract_features(results)
        
        # Perform machine learning analysis
        ml_analysis = self._perform_ml_analysis(features)
        
        # Detect threats using enhanced patterns
        threats = self._detect_threats_enhanced(features)
        
        # Classify behaviors and generate recommendations
        return enhanced_analysis_results
```
Implements machine learning-powered semantic analysis with threat detection and behavior classification.

### Intelligent Tool Selector Implementation
```python
def _calculate_tool_score(self, tool_name: str, capabilities: Dict[str, Any],
                        dump_characteristics: Dict[str, Any], 
                        system_resources: Dict[str, Any],
                        os_type: str, requirements: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]) -> float:
    score = 0.0
    
    # OS compatibility (40% weight)
    if os_type in capabilities.get("os_support", []):
        score += 0.4
        
    # Size compatibility (30% weight)
    # Performance rating (20% weight)
    # Memory efficiency (10% weight)
    
    return score
```
Implements sophisticated scoring system for optimal tool selection based on multiple factors.

### Performance Optimizer Implementation
```python
def optimize_analysis(self, dump_path: str, analysis_func: Callable, 
                    *args, **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Start performance monitoring
    self.start_monitoring()
    
    try:
        # Apply optimizations
        optimized_kwargs = self._apply_optimizations(dump_path, kwargs)
        
        # Execute analysis with monitoring
        result = analysis_func(*args, **optimized_kwargs)
        
        # Record performance metrics
        self._record_metrics(dump_path, analysis_time)
        
        return result
        
    finally:
        self.stop_monitoring()

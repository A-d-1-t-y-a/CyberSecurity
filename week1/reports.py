## Executive Summary

This literature review analyzes the base paper "Cross-Platform File System Activity Monitoring and Forensics – A Semantic Approach" and related research in memory forensics. The review identifies key semantic methodologies that can be adapted for memory forensics and establishes the theoretical foundation for the unified framework.

## Base Paper Analysis

### "Cross-Platform File System Activity Monitoring and Forensics – A Semantic Approach"

#### Key Contributions
1. **Semantic Methodology**: Novel approach to file system forensics using semantic analysis
2. **Cross-platform Support**: Unified approach across different operating systems
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced pattern recognition for forensic artifacts
4. **Standardization**: Consistent output format and analysis methodology

#### Semantic Approach
The paper introduces a semantic approach to file system forensics that:
- **Identifies patterns**: Recognizes semantic patterns in file system activities
- **Classifies behaviors**: Categorizes file system behaviors semantically
- **Detects anomalies**: Identifies unusual or suspicious activities
- **Provides context**: Offers semantic context for forensic findings

#### Methodology Adaptation
For memory forensics, the semantic approach can be adapted to:
- **Memory patterns**: Recognize semantic patterns in memory structures
- **Process behaviors**: Classify process behaviors semantically
- **Threat detection**: Detect malicious activities in memory
- **Context analysis**: Provide semantic context for memory artifacts

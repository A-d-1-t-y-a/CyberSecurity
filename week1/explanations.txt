## Command Breakdown

### Directory Creation
```python
directories = [
    'week1/logs',
    'week1/data', 
    'week1/reports',
    'week1/presentations',
    'src/framework',
    'src/utils',
    'src/tests'
]
```
Creates necessary directories for the week's work.

### Dependency Installation
```python
subprocess.run([
    sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '-r', 
    str(requirements_file), '--user'
], check=True)
```
Installs all required Python packages for the framework.

### Tool Testing
```python
result = subprocess.run(
    [command, '--help'], 
    capture_output=True, 
    text=True, 
    timeout=30
)
```
Tests each tool and logs output for validation.

### Report Generation
```python
content = f"""# Literature Review - Week 1
...
**Generated on**: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}
"""
```
Generates comprehensive reports using f-string formatting.
